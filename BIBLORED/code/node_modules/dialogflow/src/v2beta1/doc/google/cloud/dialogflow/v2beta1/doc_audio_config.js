/**
 * Description of which voice to use for speech synthesis.
 *
 * @property {string} name
 *   Optional. The name of the voice. If not set, the service will choose a
 *   voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and gender.
 *
 * @property {number} ssmlGender
 *   Optional. The preferred gender of the voice. If not set, the service will
 *   choose a voice based on the other parameters such as language_code and
 *   name. Note that this is only a preference, not requirement. If a
 *   voice of the appropriate gender is not available, the synthesizer should
 *   substitute a voice with a different gender rather than failing the request.
 *
 *   The number should be among the values of [SsmlVoiceGender]{@link google.cloud.dialogflow.v2beta1.SsmlVoiceGender}
 *
 * @typedef VoiceSelectionParams
 * @memberof google.cloud.dialogflow.v2beta1

/**
 * Configuration of how speech should be synthesized.
 *
 * @property {number} speakingRate
 *   Optional. Speaking rate/speed, in the range [0.25, 4.0]. 1.0 is the normal
 *   native speed supported by the specific voice. 2.0 is twice as fast, and
 *   0.5 is half as fast. If unset(0.0), defaults to the native 1.0 speed. Any
 *   other values < 0.25 or > 4.0 will return an error.
 *
 * @property {number} pitch
 *   Optional. Speaking pitch, in the range [-20.0, 20.0]. 20 means increase 20
 *   semitones from the original pitch. -20 means decrease 20 semitones from the
 *   original pitch.
 *
 * @property {number} volumeGainDb
 *   Optional. Volume gain (in dB) of the normal native volume supported by the
 *   specific voice, in the range [-96.0, 16.0]. If unset, or set to a value of
 *   0.0 (dB), will play at normal native signal amplitude. A value of -6.0 (dB)
 *   will play at approximately half the amplitude of the normal native signal
 *   amplitude. A value of +6.0 (dB) will play at approximately twice the
 *   amplitude of the normal native signal amplitude. We strongly recommend not
 *   to exceed +10 (dB) as there's usually no effective increase in loudness for
 *   any value greater than that.
 *
 * @property {string[]} effectsProfileId
 *   Optional. An identifier which selects 'audio effects' profiles that are
 *   applied on (post synthesized) text to speech. Effects are applied on top of
 *   each other in the order they are given.
 *
 * @property {Object} voice
 *   Optional. The desired voice of the synthesized audio.

 *   This object should have the same structure as [VoiceSelectionParams]{@link google.cloud.dialogflow.v2beta1.VoiceSelectionParams}

 *
 * @property {number} sampleRateHertz
 *   Optional. The synthesis sample rate (in hertz) for this audio. If not
 *   provided, then the synthesizer will use the default sample rate based on

 *   rate, then the synthesizer will honor this request by converting to the
